#1) Make two string variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
a = "your" + "name"
print(a)

#2) Make two int variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
b= 4 + 4
print(b)

#3) Make two int variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
c= 5-4
print(c)

#4) Make two float variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
d= 5.5-4.2
print(d)
#5) Make two int variables and use the * operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
e= 5*4
print(e)

#6) Make one string variable and one int variable and use the * operator 
#to combine them into one new variable.
f= "your"* 3
print(f)

#7) Make two int variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
g= 12/2
print(g)

#8) Make two float variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
h= 1.5/0.5
print(h)
#9) Make two int variables and use the % operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
i=5%4
print(i)

#10) Make two int variables and use the // operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
j=5//4
print(j)

#11) Make two int variables and use the ** operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
k=2**2
print(k)

#12) Make any type of operation with a common SYNTAX error
 l= 2**2
 print(m)
