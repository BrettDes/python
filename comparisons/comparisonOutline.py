This outline will help solidify concepts from the Comparison Operators lesson.
Fill in this outline as the instructor goes through the lesson.

#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
a="bike"=="chain"
print(a)

#2) Make two int variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
b= 4==4
print(b)
#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
c=2>3
print(c)


#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
d=3<4
print(d)

#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
e=4>=3
print(e)


#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
f=3<=4
print(f)


#7) Make a comparison with any operator, with one of the common SYNTAX errors.
g=3==4
print(h)
