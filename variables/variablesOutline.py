#1)
#Make an example variable of each of the types of variables (int, float, 
#string, boolean and list):
a = 5
a =3.45
a = "Samantha and Michael"
a= True
a=[1,2,3,4]



#2)
#Make two variables one named 'a' and one named 'A' both set to  different data:
#(Remember that capitalization matters, so these can be two different variables)
vara=2
varA =1


#3)
#Make a variable, and then go down a couple lines and change the data in that
#same variable:
a=1

a=2

#4)
#Make a variable and set it to a variable you have already created:
b=a


#5)
#Make a list with three items. Make a variable that is set to the second
#item in that list:
list=["a","b","c"]
varList=list[1]

#6)
#Make a String set to your name. Make a variable that is set to the first
#character in that string:
string="Brett"
bString= string[0]


#7)
#Print out ONE of any of the variables you have created so far:
print(bString)


#8)
#Make a variable of any type, with one of the common SYNTAX errors
